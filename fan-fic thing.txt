Female Player x Brandon

The player stumbles through a dark office space, the lights illuminating from the player's flashlight lightens the area slightly as to not render the room useless
Moaning and crying can be heard

Player: H-h-hello?, Is anyone there?

A voice calls out

Brandon: P-p-please, don't hurt me

A figurine of a big muscled man with glasses comes into the player's view

Player: Wh-h-o are you?

Brandon: I am Brandon, one of the creators of this dark world, it's not really safe here, could you please help me out?

Player: Visible blushing S-sure, I'll help you out, I'm kind of lonely out here, do you mind?

The player makes her hand visible, no wedding ring in sight

Brandon holds her hand gently as to not harm her
Later they find their way out onto the roof tops, the clock tower is visible in the distance

Brandon: Well this is it, the end of MythOS

Player: Yeah, that's a real shame, I never found anyone to love out here

Brandon: Well, maybe there's still time?

Brandon takes off his T-Shirt, revealing his strong muscly body

The player, turned on by this, immediately begins to remove their clothing, Brandon speeds up and does the same

Just as the clock counts down to 00:00, Brandon says his last words

Brandon: I'm going to be honest here, I'm a total virgin and have no Idea what I'm doing

Player: sniff same... Let's try do this together and see if we're doing this right

Brandon: I know we just met but I love you <3

Player: I feel the same way Brandon <3

Brandon "Deflowers" the Player as the clock hits 00:00 and the world they lived in is no more, leaving only their lust and love behind
